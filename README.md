## Project Overview
This project predicts house prices in Bangalore based on features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The model is built using **Linear Regression** and deployed with **Streamlit** for user-friendly interaction.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- **Location**
- **Total square feet**
- **BHK (Number of bedrooms)**
- **Bathrooms**
- **Price (Target variable)**

## Installation
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit pickle-mixin
```

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, remove outliers, and perform feature engineering.
2. **Model Training**: Train a Linear Regression model.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using R¬≤ score.
4. **Deployment**: Deploy using Streamlit.

## How to Use the Repository
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. **Interact with the application**:
